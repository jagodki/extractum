# Extractum
Automatic import and export of multiple tables or datasets from one PostgreSQL database to another.

## Goal of the project
This application is a little tool to import and export multiple datasets into/from a PostgreSQL database. With this tool it is not necessary to import/export every single table/datasets one after one using e.g. QGIS or PostgreSQL-commands.

## Preliminary remark
This project uses Java SE 8 and Netbeans 8.2. It is not tested against other versions of the named products.
The software is available under the terms of Apache 2.0, so feel free to use (or contribute to) the project. ^^
All documentation and the GUI are realised in english language. No further internationalisation is realised already.

## Usage and hints
It also creates a configuration file of the export for further usage. The data will be exported into XML files (for storing the configuration) and CSV files (the datasets).
